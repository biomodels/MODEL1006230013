**Abstract:**   
Mathematical modeling has proven to be valuable in understanding of the
complex biological systems dynamics. In the present report we have developed
an initial model of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system self-regulatory
activity. A four-dimensional non-linear differential equation model of the
hormone secretion was formulated and used to analyze plasma cortisol levels in
humans. The aim of this work was to explore in greater detail the role of this
system in normal, homeostatic, conditions, since it is the first and
unavoidable step in further understanding of the role of this complex
neuroendocrine system in pathophysiological conditions. Neither the underlying
mechanisms nor the physiological significance of this system are fully
understood yet.

This model was taken from the [CellML
